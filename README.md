# christa.town

The personal blog of me, Christa Hartsock, built with Jekyll and served via Github Pages.

## Notes to self

### Using the static site generator

Do this the first time:

```
bundle install
```

Do this every time:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Making a blog post

Make a new file in `./_posts` in format YYYY-MM-DD-this-is-a-title.md. Put contents in it. Consider editing it. Commit and push.
